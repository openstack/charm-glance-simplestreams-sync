    description: >
      A Python-style .format() template to use when generating

      The content_id is considered when matching images between the
      source and destination to decide which images to mirror.  By
      varying this value you can mirror disjoint sets of images from
      the same source into a single glance, either by using multiple
      deployments of this charm, or by using a tool such as
      sstream-mirror-glance, and they will not interfere with each
      other.

      Here is a more interesting example value:

          com.example.customstack.{region}:ubuntu:celery-worker

      Currently the only available substitution is "region".  Any
      other attempted substitutions will break the sync script.

      A string that will be prepended to instance name to set the host name
      in nagios. So for instance the hostname would be something like:
          juju-myservice-0
      If you're running multiple environments with the same services in them
      this allows you to differentiate between them.

    description: |
